## Development Environment

1. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv env`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `. env/bin/activate`
3. Install development dependencies: `pip install -e '.[dev]'`
4. Hack away :tada:

## Running Tests

The tests do make requests to the Smartcar API, so you'll need to create an application on Smartcar and get the client id and client secret

1. Create an application on the [developer dashboard](https://dashboard.smartcar.com)
2. Pass the client id and client secret to the tests as environment variables

```
export INTEGRATION_CLIENT_ID=''
export INTEGRATION_CLIENT_SECRET=''
```

3. Run tests: `make test args="--verbose"`

## Creating a pull request

Please make sure to bump the version number in `smartcar/__init__.py` in accordance with [semver](https://semver.org/) when making a pull request to the `master` branch.
